# School-System

This is a school system done in Object oriented java using files and arraylists and data structure. 
Here I have described the operation that can be done by a user in my school (University of New York Tirana).
The code is not in GUI, because this program is done only for learing purposes and showing abilities in OOP in JAVA.
 The program has 4 main classes.
 
- You have a menu in which you can do all possible operation using arraylists and files

- The progam has only backend logic and if you need it for your  school system , just change the program (local program or suny program )

- This program contains polymorphism

- No interfaces implemented

- The data are stored in files, not in databases

- All the operations are based in the student ID. 

- Create for each student a specific file with an unique student_id



# # Adding student's info into file and into arraylist.
